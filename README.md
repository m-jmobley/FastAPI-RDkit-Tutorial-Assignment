# FastAPI-RDkit-Tutorial-Assignment

1. In order to run this assignment begin by initializing the FastAPI instance by running the api__init__.py file from the command line using the following command uvicorn api__init__:app --reload.
2. Once the API is initialized from the command line run the GUI.py file, you will be prompted to provide a SMILE string then a SMART string.
3. At this point the program should return the products from the resulting reactants to the user and the user will be prompted to give another SMILE and SMART to run reaction on if desired (Haven't implemented this step yet will in future)
